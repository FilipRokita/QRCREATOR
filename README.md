# QRCreator.py

QRCreator is a simple Python script that allows you to generate QR codes from text input. The script uses the popular `qrcode` library to create QR codes and `Pillow` library to save the generated QR code as an image file.

## How to Use

To use QRCreator, run the script in your Python environment and input the text you want to encode into a QR code. Click the "CREATE" button to generate the QR code, which will be saved as a PNG image file in the same directory as the script.

## Dependencies

This script requires the `qrcode` and `Pillow` libraries to be installed in your Python environment.
